Arctic foxes are built for the cold,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.300
with thick white fur that even covers the pads of their feet

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.479
and ears that are rounded to make them less susceptible to frostbite.

00:00:19.299 --> 00:00:23.530
These captive foxes are part of a government funded

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.159
effort in Dovre to preserve the species.

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:37.220
Arctic foxes are critically endangered in Norway,

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.630
and this breeding programme in the Nordryggen mountains is trying to bring them back from the brink.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.950
The senior scientist here is a Arild Landa

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.349
because the arctic fox has a very nice and valuable winter fur,

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:58.060
it was hunted down to very low populations.

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:02.639
In the beginning of 1900's a nice blue arctic fox skin was paid with 800 kk,

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:09.720
which equals to one year salary at that time.
