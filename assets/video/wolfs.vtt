In the grasslands above Mjøsa-fjord, farmers have been grazing their sheep for centuries.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
Last year, the farmer here lost 40% of his flock to wolves.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Erling Åseng represents farmers in the area,

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
and wants the call of about two thirds of Norway's wild wolves to go ahead.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000 line:75%

00:21.000 --> 00:31.000
They get psychologically tired because of all this threat to find carcasses during the summer, dead and half dead.

00:31.000 --> 00:40.000
It's not a situation you can live with for years, then you give up farming simply, and that has happened.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
A few hours drive north into the Norwegian wilderness,

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
and wolves at this reserve roam in a large fenced-off area.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000 line:75%
[Wolf barks in distance] 
00:48.000 --> 00:56.000
Norway has just under 70 wolves living in the wild, and others like this group which live in sanctuaries.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000 line:75%
[Howling wolf] 
00:56.000 --> 01:04.000
The wolves here are used to human beings, meaning we're allowed to get this close, but they still like to keep their distance.

01:04.000 --> 01:10.000
Campaigners say this is a creature which is often stigmatized and is largely misunderstood.

01:10.000 --> 01:20.000
The planned cull then has alarmed those who believe wolves in the wild are persecuted and are already at risk from illegal hunting.

01:20.000 --> 01:28.000
Some environmentalists say on a national level, under two percent of sheep which die are killed by wolves.

[Three people walking in track] 
So to spot one today we'd have to be very, very lucky really.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Really, really lucky.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Most people in Norway will never see a wolf in the wild.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
Conservationists close to Oslo are monitoring an area using special cameras to track wolves.

01:40.000 --> 01:45.000 line:75%
[monitoring equipment synthesizing] 

01:45.000 --> 01:48.000
The population has never been very high.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.000
Now it's a little bit higher, but it's still only like between 65 and 70 in the rituals that live only in Norway,

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
and to allow a hunt that will take away like the thirst of that, it's too much for such a small population.

02:01.000 --> 02:10.000
More than 40 years after wolves were given protected status here, the decision to control their numbers is controversial,

[Muffled talk in background] 
02:10.000 --> 02:20.000
putting farmers who face challenging times against environmentalists who are determined to safeguard the future of the wolf in Norway.
