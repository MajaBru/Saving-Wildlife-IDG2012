            <p>Arctic foxes are built for the cold, </p>
            <p>with thick white fur that even covers the pads of their feet, </p>
            <p>and ears that are rounded to make them less susceptible to frostbite.</p>
            <p>These captive foxes are part of a government funded</p>
            <p>effort in Dovre to preserve the species.</p>
            <p>Arctic foxes are critically endangered in Norway, </p>
            <p>and this breeding programme in the Nordryggen mountains is trying to bring them back from the brink.</p>
            <p>The senior scientist here is a Arild Landa.</p>
            <p>Because the arctic fox has a very nice and valuable winter fur, </p>
            <p>it was hunted down to very low populations in the beginning of 1900's.</p>
            <p>A nice blue arctic fox skin was paid with 800 kr, </p>
            <p>which equals to one year salary at that time.</p>

            <h2>FOCUS: The Norwegian wolf controversy</h2>

            <p>In Norway, the wolf is listed on the red list as "critically endangered". 
                In the winter of 2016/2017, 105-112 wolves were detected with full or partial residence on Norwegian
                    land - 54-56 who only stayed within the land border, and 51-56 who lived on the Norwegian 
                    and Swedish sides. But the number of wolves varies greatly mortality, and may suddenly be 
                    down again to 30-40 wolves on the Norwegian side.</p>

            <p>The wolf plays a significant role in the dynamics of the northern ecosystems. 
                Behavioral patterns in reindeer, bison, musk deer, elk and a number of other game 
                species reflect an evolutionary adaptation to wolves. The Scandinavian ecosystems have 
                in practice been without wolves for 100 years, and have developed completely differently 
                than they would have done with wolves present.</p>

                <h2>Transcript: The wolf controversy</h2>
                    <i>( Sheep Baaing )</i>
                    <p>In the grasslands above Mjøsa-fjord, farmers have been grazing their sheep for centuries.</p>
                    <i>( Sheep bells ringing )</i>
                    <p>Last year, the farmer here lost 40% of his flock to wolves.</p>
                    <p>Erling Åseng represents farmers in the area, and wants the call of about two thirds of Norway's wild wolves to go ahead.</p>
                    <i>( Sheep Baaing )</i>
                    <p>They get psychologically tired because of all this threat to find carcasses during the summer, dead and half dead.</p>
                    <p>It's not a situation you can live with for years, then you give up farming simply, and that has happened.</p>
                    <p>A few hours drive north into the Norwegian wilderness,</p>
                    <p>and wolves at this reserve roam in a large fenced-off area.</p>
                    <i>( Wolf barks in distance )</i>
                    <p>Norway has just under 70 wolves living in the wild, and others like this group which live in sanctuaries.</p>
                    <i>( Howling wolf )</i>
                    <p> The wolves here are used to human beings, meaning we're allowed to get this close, but they still like to keep their distance.</p>
                    <p>Campaigners say this is a creature which is often stigmatized and is largely misunderstood.</p>
                    <p>The planned cull then has alarmed those who believe wolves in the wild are persecuted and are already at risk from illegal hunting.</p>
                    <i>( Wolves steps on crisp grass )</i>
                    <i>( Wolf sniffing )</i>
                    <p>Some environmentalists say on a national level, under two percent of sheep which die are killed by wolves.</p>
                    <i>( Three people walking in track )</i>
                    <p>So to spot one today we'd have to be very, very lucky really.</p>
                    <p>Really, really lucky.</p>
                    <p>Most people in Norway will never see a wolf in the wild.</p>
                    <p>Conservationists close to Oslo are monitoring an area using special cameras to track wolves.</p>
                    <i>( Monitoring equipment synthesizing )</i>
                    <p>The population has never been very high.</p>
                    <p>Now it's a little bit higher, but it's still only like between 65 and 70 in the rituals that live only in Norway,</p>
                    <p>and to allow a hunt that will take away like the thirst of that, it's too much for such a small population.</p>
                    <p>More than 40 years after wolves were given protected status here, the decision to control their numbers is controversial,</p>
                    <p>putting farmers who face challenging times against environmentalists who are determined to safeguard the future of the wolf in Norway.</p>
